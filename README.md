# hello-world
This repository is for familiarizing myself with GitHub as part of my coding class. 
I'm a technical business analyst working for a non-profit based in Cincinnati, OH and am hoping that this course will help me get better with the data analytics that my company needs. 
I'm also a wife and mom of two humans and four dogs. 
My ultimate goal is to open a dog boarding and rescue facility to help the dogs that frequently get overlooked (elderly, special needs, etc.).
Other than that, I love to read, watch movies, hang out with my family, make and eat food, and sleep when time allows.
